					<h1>Institutional Camping</h1>
					<p>One week of camping in the entrance hall of ArtEZ in a small tent. People were invited in for Shelter Sessions, tea and fruits and a talk. The goal of the project was to find out more about how space influences social interaction. With a printer and laptop the promotional material was designed and printed inside the tent.<br />
<br />
Also at the bottom of this page: video footage of the project and an interview with myself about this project.</p>
