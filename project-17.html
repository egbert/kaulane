					<h1>Voice of Korea</h1>
					<p>From the website "The Voice of Korea" a North Korean government radio website, 5 images were derived into 5 sets of buttons. The button as a symbol of protest in a highly controlled grid of one set image in a society where publicly protesting is, for as far as we know, impossible.<br />
<br />
Next to the images that were bound to be in a certain grid (without the grid, th image does not exist, for the seperate buttons did not really depict anything) there was a set of word buttons. Since all there is to say about North Korea from the North-Korean perspective is extremely positive, there were just positive or great words on the buttons. You can form your own combinations with them, but they will always remain positive.<br />
