					<h1>Thuis zonder Thuis</h1>
					<p>I came to find that all the houses in Enschede that I lived in (I moved about 5 times) were either removed or destroyed. Visiting these places, I took pictures and combined those with pictures of the houses that I do still have. This is all there is left of the houses that I grew up in. ("Thuis zonder Thuis" means "Home without a Home")</p>
