With this notion I scraped about a week of news images from, filtering them into seperate categories. From these categories four posters were made: explosions, men in suits, crowds and military forses. With the "Breaking News" banner You can then create your own Breaking News - Live.</div>

I wanted to get closer to him, to get to know him, but in the end we usually talk about plants, about the weather maybe, but hardly ever do we speak of what really matters: our shared past, his life, my life. I would almost call our relationship superficial, which it is not. This is the way we communicate, and the pictures I took symbolize this relationship. They show what we talk about, they show that I cannot get closer to my father in a very direct way, but we have a mutual understanding of things when speaking of mutual interest. By showing an excessive amount of what we do talk about, what really is missing, is what we don't talk about. </div>
