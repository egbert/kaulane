					<h1>2 WORDS</h1>
					<p>Five posters plus one poster combining the five; all the names and words are random outcomes of google searches that provided for the information asked for in the instructions that I was given (the last picture). Those instructions were given to me by a classmate that made them after another poster. The posters contain the exact information asked for in the instructions. The instructions seemed random, which was then the starting point for the five posters. </p>
