					<h1>Transition Exhibition</h1>
					<p>What happens when you have a limited amount of physical living space? How will you occupy that space and how does this then influence your use of digital space? By comparing the amount of available data in 2020 to all of the buildable space available on the planet's surface, 1MB then equals 36CM3.<br />
<br />
Thus a speculation arose on how to occupy digital space as a living place and how to then inhibit limited physical space. <br /><br />The research resulted in four projects, that together formed an installation. <br />
Part of this project was then a rectangular tent in which visitors of the exhibition, where this collaborative project was displayed, could experience such a small space and get in conversation about the subject, to gain a broader sense of what the concept of space might be.<br />
<br />
All the objects presented in the installation were accompanied by a sticker telling how much its real physical space would be in digital space, calculated using the comparison. <br />
<br />
The Exhibition took place January in Showroom Arnhem, The Netherlands.<br />
<br />
In collaboration with Sandra bakker, Carlijn Veuring and GÃ¶khan Kaman.</p>
