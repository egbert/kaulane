					<h1>Chance Seeker Typetool</h1>
					<p>Typetool that focusses on apophenia, the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data. This tool enables you to derive type from random patterns. <br />
<br />
The typetool-kit consists of the typesheets and a perforating tool. To use the tool, you place a type-sheet over the image that you would like to derive type from. You then look for a reference point in the image within the circles that border the type's reference points. Perforate the reference points, remove the type-sheet and connect the perforated points in the image, to create the letter you were looking for. Cut out the letter and use it to shape words. ~Have fun. <br />
