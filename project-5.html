					<h1>Extrapool Graphic Shop</h1>
					<p>For Extrapool's Little Shop, I designed the logo and redecorated the shop. The shop is based in NIjmegen, The Netherlands and is filled with stencilprinted matter, stencilprinted at Knust and music bought from artists that performed in Extrapool or that is recorded and produced in Extrapool by various artists.<br />
<br />
The Extrapool Graphic Shop, just as Extrapool, focusses on experimental works ranging from print to sound and tries to show its variety in a very small but friendly space. It tries to create a platform for both known and less known artists to show their work, and to show the beauty of stencil print.<br />
