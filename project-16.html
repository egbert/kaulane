					<h1>Breaking News - Live</h1>
					<p>The images shown in the news are not always what we think they are - framing really does a lot to the perception of an image. With this notion I scraped about a week of news images from, filtering them into seperate categories. From these categories four posters were made: explosions, men in suits, crowds and military forses. With the "Breaking News" banner You can then create your own Breaking News - Live.</p>
